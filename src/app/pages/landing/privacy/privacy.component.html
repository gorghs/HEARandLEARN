<h1>
  Privacy Policy for <code>My Cool App</code>
</h1>
<p><strong>Effective date: 20 June 2025</strong></p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>we</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and safeguards your
  personal data when you interact with the
  <code>My Cool App</code> service available at
  our website and its related applications.<br />We process information in accordance with the
  <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> and other applicable data protection laws, and we review this notice periodically to ensure it
  remains accurate and up-to-date.
</p>
<h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
<p>
  <strong>My Cool App Team</strong> is the data controller responsible for any personal data processed in connection with
  <code>My Cool App</code>.<br />You can reach our privacy team at
  <a href="mailto:privacy&#64;example.com">privacy&#64;example.com</a> for any inquiries or to exercise your data-protection rights.
</p>
<p>
  Our guiding principle is data-minimisation.<br />Whenever feasible, processing happens locally on your device,
  limiting the amount of information transmitted across the internet.<br />Remote processing is performed only when
  necessary to deliver high-quality features.
</p>
<h2>2. What Data We Collect and Why</h2>
<p>
  When you submit text for processing, our backend records the request, a salted-and-hashed version of your IP address,
  and diagnostic details that help us keep the service reliable and secure.<br />For some features, the full input is logged because we need it to evaluate and improve
  service quality.<br />These logs reside in cloud storage on encrypted storage
  and are automatically deleted once they are no longer operationally required.
</p>
<p>
  If you opt in through our cookie banner, we gather aggregated analytics such as page paths, browser type, device
  category, and language settings.<br />This data helps us understand overall usage
  patterns and prioritise product improvements.<br />Declining or later withdrawing consent stops analytics collection
  immediately.
</p>
<p>
  Certain advanced features may send your input to third-party APIs for
  processing.<br />These requests are covered by their respective privacy policies.
</p>
<h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
<p>
  We rely on performance of a contract under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR to deliver services you explicitly request.<br />Diagnostic
  logging is processed under our legitimate interests in maintaining service integrity under Article 6(1)(f).<br />Analytics
  and optional features that send data to third parties are processed on the basis of your explicit consent under
  Article 6(1)(a).<br />You may revoke consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing carried out
  before withdrawal.
</p>
<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  All information is stored on encrypted infrastructure hosted on a major cloud provider.<br />Access is restricted to authorized
  personnel, and all third-party providers operate under GDPR-aligned data-processing agreements.
</p>
<h2>5. International Transfers</h2>
<p>
  Where data leaves your region—including transfers to other countries—we rely on
  <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> and comparable mechanisms to ensure an essentially
  equivalent level of protection as required by data protection laws.
</p>
<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
  You have the right to request access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, and portability of your
  personal data, as well as the right to object to certain processing activities. Please note that because we anonymize
  request logs and remove direct identifiers, we may be unable to locate any data that can be linked back to you
  personally. To exercise any of these rights, contact us at
  <a href="mailto:privacy&#64;example.com">privacy&#64;example.com</a>.<br />You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your
  local supervisory authority.
</p>
<h2>7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We update this Privacy Policy when our technology, legal obligations, or data-handling practices change.<br />The most
  recent version is always available on our website, and the “Effective date” above reflects the date of the latest
  substantive revision.
